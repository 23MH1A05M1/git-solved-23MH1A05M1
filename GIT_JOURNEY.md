## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Production used port 8080, development used 3000
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Different database hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different feature lists and version numbers
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes


### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)
#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml

- **Issue**: Main branch used stable production settings, while conflict-simulator introduced AI-enabled testing configuration with multiple ports and advanced cloud settings.

- **Resolution**: Unified both into a single YAML supporting environment-based profiles.

- **Strategy**: Kept production as default and added experimental/testing mode as an optional section.

- **Difficulty**: Medium

- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json

- **Issue**: Main had standard PostgreSQL setup; conflict-simulator used distributed database with AI-driven caching and multi-master replication.

- **Resolution**: Merged both by creating environment-based database objects for production and experimental.

- **Strategy**: Added "distributed" and "ai_optimization" flags to distinguish database behavior.

- **Difficulty**: Medium

- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh

- **Issue**: Main handled production CI/CD deployment; conflict-simulator added AI-simulated and chaos testing paths.

- **Resolution**: Added environment condition to detect whether deployment is for production or experimental.

- **Strategy**: Used DEPLOY_ENV variable to switch between standard pipeline and experimental simulation mode.

- **Difficulty**: Hard

- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js

- **Issue**: Main contained a standard production/development monitor; conflict-simulator had an AI-based predictive system with multi-cloud status tracking.

- **Resolution**: Combined both to form a unified monitoring script supporting AI mode, environment detection, and predictive analytics.

- **Strategy**: Merged configurations under process.env.MONITOR_ENV to dynamically enable AI-based monitoring for experimental runs.

- **Difficulty**: Hard

- **Time**: 25 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md

- **Issue**: Main had standard system architecture; conflict-simulator introduced AI/ML-based architecture with event-driven microservices and multi-cloud orchestration.

- **Resolution**: Combined both into a single architecture document describing production and experimental builds separately.

- **Strategy**: Added two sections - “Production Architecture“ and “Experimental Architecture” for clarity.

- **Difficulty**: Easy

- **Time**e: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md

- **Issue**: Main contained stable version details; conflict-simulator added AI experimental features and cloud integrations.

- **Resolution**: Merged README with version history and clear labeling of stable vs experimental features.

- **Strategy**: Organized features under “Production Features” and “Experimental Features” sections.

- **Difficulty**: Easy

- **Time**: 10 minutes


## Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**: Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes.

2. **Deciding What to Keep**: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**: deploy.sh had completely different logic. Had to understand both approaches before combining.

4. **Testing After Resolution**: Making sure resolved code actually worked was crucial.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution process
- Understood merge conflict markers
- Learned to use git diff effectively
- Practiced all major Git commands

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides of conflict before resolving
- Test resolved code before committing
- Write detailed merge commit messages
- Use git status frequently
- Commit atomically

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal, not errors
- Take time to understand both changes
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
- Document your resolution strategy
- Keep calm and read carefully

## Reflection
This challenge taught me that merge conflicts aren't scary - they're 
just Git asking "which version do you want?". The key is understanding 
what each side is trying to do before combining them. I now feel 
confident handling conflicts in real projects.

The hands-on practice with all Git commands (especially rebase and 
cherry-pick) was invaluable. I understand the difference between merge 
and rebase, and when to use each. Most importantly, I learned that 
git reflog is a lifesaver!
