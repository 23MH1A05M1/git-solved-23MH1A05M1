# System Architecture

## Overview
DevOps Simulator follows a microservices architecture designed for high availability and scalability. This document covers production and development configurations as primary. Experimental features and architecture are listed separately and are NOT production-ready.

## Components

### 1. Application Server
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express
- **Production Port**: 8080
- **Development Port**: 3000
- **Scaling**: Horizontal auto-scaling (production only)
- **Development Features**: Hot reload, debug mode (port 9229)

### 2. Database Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14
- **Production**: Master-slave replication with automated backups
- **Development**: Single local instance with seed data

### 3. Monitoring System
- **Production**: Prometheus + Grafana with email alerts
- **Development**: Console logging with verbose output
- **Metrics**: CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, Build time

### 4. Container Orchestration
- **Tool**: Docker Compose
- **Production**: Managed containers with orchestration tools (Kubernetes for production workloads)
- **Development**: Local setup with code directory mounts for hot reload

### 5. Authentication System
- **Method**: OAuth2 + JWT
- **Providers**: Google, GitHub
- **Production**: Redis-based session storage with encryption
- **Development**: Plain session storage for testing

## Deployment Strategy

### Production
- **Method**: Rolling updates
- **Zero-downtime**: Yes
- **Rollback**: Automated on failure
- **Region**: us-east-1

### Development
- **Method**: Docker Compose
- **Features**: Hot reload, instant feedback
- **Testing**: Automated unit tests before deployment

## Security
- **Production**: SSL/TLS encryption, strict access controls, regular audits
- **Development**: Relaxed security (CORS enabled, plain credentials for testing)

## Experimental Architecture (NOT production-ready)
> The following is experimental / advanced architecture and features. **Do not enable in production**. Keep these behind a feature flag, separate branch, or in a separate `experimental` document.

### Overview (Experimental)
DevOps Simulator follows an **event-driven microservices architecture** with AI/ML integration, designed for multi-cloud deployments and chaos engineering.

**⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL**: This architecture includes untested cutting-edge features.

### 1. Application Server (AI-Enhanced)
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express + TensorFlow.js
- **Ports**: 9000 (main), 9001 (metrics), 9002 (AI API)
- **Scaling**: AI-powered predictive auto-scaling
- **Intelligence**: Real-time ML inference
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event streaming

### 2. Distributed Database Layer (Experimental)
- **Primary**: PostgreSQL 14 cluster (multi-node)
- **Cache**: Redis cluster with ML-based cache optimization
- **Configuration**: Multi-master or clustered replication (experimental)
- **Backup**: Continuous backup with geo-redundancy
- **AI Features**: Query optimization, index suggestions

### 3. AI/ML Pipeline
- **Framework**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Models**:
  - Anomaly detection (LSTM)
  - Load prediction (XGBoost)
  - Auto-scaling optimizer (Reinforcement Learning)
- **Training**: Continuous online learning (experimental)
- **Inference**: Real-time predictions (target <50ms latency)

### 4. Multi-Cloud Orchestration
- **Supported Clouds**: AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean
- **Orchestrator**: Kubernetes with custom CRDs (experimental)
- **Load Balancing**: Global anycast with GeoDNS
- **Failover**: Automatic cross-cloud failover (experimental)

### 5. Advanced Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus + Thanos (long-term storage)
- **Logs**: ELK Stack + AI log analysis
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with Jaeger/Zipkin
- **Alerting**: AI-assisted anomaly detection and alert suppression

### Experimental Features (examples)
- Multi-cloud deployment
- AI-powered log analysis
- Automatic rollback triggered by anomaly detection
- Chaos engineering and automated fault-injection workflows

## Notes & Recommendations
1. Keep **production** architecture and configuration as the source of truth for `main`/`prod` branch.
2. Place experimental systems behind feature flags or in a dedicated `experimental` branch and never enable them in production without staging validation and security review.
3. Consider moving the experimental architecture into `docs/experimental.md` or `architecture/experimental.md` for clarity.
4. Add a short checklist before enabling experimental features in any environment (security review, performance testing, monitoring enabled, rollback tested).
